# 🛡️ ZEROPOINT

**One tap. Zero exposure. Total control.**

ZEROPOINT is the definitive answer to the question Sundar Pichai couldn’t answer simply in 2018.

-----

## What It Does

ZEROPOINT gives you a single button to instantly disable every sensor, tracker, and permission on your phone:

- 📍 Location Services
- 🎙️ Microphone Access
- 📷 Camera Access
- 📶 Bluetooth
- 🎯 Ad Tracking
- 🔄 Background App Refresh
- 📱 Motion & Activity Sensors
- 📋 Clipboard Access
- 📡 NFC
- 🌐 Background Network Activity

When you deactivate Privacy Mode, every permission restores to exactly its prior individual state. Not a blanket re-enable — each app’s unique prior permission is restored precisely.

-----

## What It Does NOT Do

- ❌ Collect any data
- ❌ Transmit anything anywhere
- ❌ Use any servers or cloud services
- ❌ Require an account
- ❌ Access your photos, messages, contacts, or any personal content
- ❌ Use any third-party analytics or advertising SDKs

-----

## Why It Exists

Built because Big Tech breached billions:

- **Yahoo:** 3 billion accounts
- **Ticketmaster:** 560 million users
- **Equifax:** 147 million people
- **Cambridge Analytica:** 87 million users

ZEROPOINT is the privacy control they never gave you.

## Architecture

- **Framework:** React Native (Expo)
- **State Management:** React Hooks
- **Storage:** AsyncStorage (encrypted on-device only)
- **Network:** None. Zero network calls.
- **Analytics:** None.
- **Third-party SDKs:** None.

-----

## Privacy Architecture

All data stays on your device. Always.

**What ZEROPOINT stores:**

1. A snapshot of your permission states (encrypted locally) — so it can restore them
1. An audit log of the last 25 toggle events (encrypted locally) — deletable by you

**What ZEROPOINT NEVER does:**

- Send data to servers (there are no servers)
- Create accounts (there is no account system)
- Track usage (there is no analytics)
- Collect personal information (impossible by design)

Even if compelled, there is nothing to hand over because nothing exists anywhere except on your device, encrypted, under your control.

## Acknowledgments

Built in response to the 2018 congressional hearing where Rep. Ted Poe asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai:

> “If I’m walking from here over to the left, does Google know that?”

With ZEROPOINT active, the answer is definitively **no**.
